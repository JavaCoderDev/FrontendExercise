		HTML DOESN'T PROVIDE A HUGE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS for
us to work with. The selection available is more like that of a
corner store than a Walmart.
<br>
<br>
We have paragraphs, lists, and headlines but we don't have 
events, news stories, or recipes. HTML gives us an element
for marking up a string as an abbreviation, but it doesn't give
us an element for marking up a number as a price.
<br>
<br>
Clearly, this limitation hasn't been a show-stopper; just look
at the amazing variety of websites out there. Even though
HTML might not provide a specific element for marking up a
particular piece of content, it provides just enough flexibility
to be "good enough."

		EXTENSIBILITY
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		Other markup languages allow you to invent any element
		you want. In XML, if you want an <code style="color:#66FFFF">event</code> element or a <code style="color:#66FFFF">price</code>
		element, you just go right ahead and create it. The downside
		 to this freedom is that you then have to teach a parser what
<code style="color:#66FFFF">event</code> or <code style="color:#66FFFF">price</code> means. 
The advantage to HTML's limited set
 of elements is that every user agent knows about every element. Browsers have a built-in knowledge of HTML. That
 wouldn't be possible if we were allowed to make up element
  names.
<br>
<br>
HTML provides a handy escape clause that allows web designers to add more semantic value to elements: the <code style="color:#66FFFF">class</code>
attribute. This attribute allows us to label specific instances
of an element as being a special class or type of that element.
The fact that browsers don't understand the vocabulary we
use in our <code style="color:#66FFFF">class</code> attributes doesn't affect the rendering of our
documents.
<br>
<br>
If, at this point, you're thinking "Wait a minute; aren't classes
for CSS?" then you're half right. The CSS class selector is one
example of a technology that makes use of the <code style="color:#66FFFF">class</code> attribute
but it isn't the onlyreason for using classes. Classes can also be
used in DOM Scripting. They can even be used by browsers
if the class names follow an agreed convention, as is the case
with microformats.

		Microformats
	</h3>
	<p>
		
		Microformats are a set ofconventions which are agreed upon
by a community. These formats use the <code style="color:#66FFFF">class</code> attribute to plug
some of the more glaring holes in HTML: hCard for contact
details, hCalendar for events, hAtom for news stories. Because
there is a community consensus on what class names to use,
there are now parsers and browser extensions that work with
those specific patterns.
